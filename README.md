This is a very and incomplete version of achtung die kurve I coded to get a bit of experience in c++. I axed the project since for me, it started to become pointless.
To me the goal was to gain experience - not to make a finished game, and so I feel like I fully absorbed all the knowledge I needed to, and so now I will start learning about other things.
Hope to see you next time! If you need any help with taking the base game and changing things, feel free to contact me. 


To add players just copy and paste the addplayer function (with different parameters of course) on main.cpp .

(Ps: SDL is not the best library if you want and need to use circles in your game, as it is made to be for more simple things, I'm pretty sure. It's probably not a good idea to code achtung this way.)
